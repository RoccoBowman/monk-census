Replication code for Ryavec and Bowman (2021), "Comparing Historical Tibetan Population Estimates with the Monks and Nuns: What was the Clerical Proportion?", in which Tibetan farmland and other envrionmental and social factors are used to estimate the clerical population of historical Tibet.

The census script cleans and prepares the census data to then be spatially joined to monestary points within QGIS.
